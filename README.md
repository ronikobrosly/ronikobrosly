======================================

Hi, I'm Roni üëã. 

I'm the current Head of the Data Science at DrFirst, a Washington DC-based Health Tech company. I'm also the creator and maintainer of the open-source python package [`causal-curve`](https://github.com/ronikobrosly/causal-curve), which offers a collection of tools to perform causal inference analysis.
